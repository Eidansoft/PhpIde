		<h1>PHPIde</h1>
		<div>PHPIde is a cloud IDE (Integrated Development Environment) solution created just for fun :-)
		This application has been developed by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alejandro-d%C3%A9cimo-8b91b672">my-self</a> at my spare time.
		All sources are avaiable at the GIT repository under <a href="https://github.com/Eidansoft/PhpIde">Github</a>.
		Please feel free to try it out or giving me your feedback.
		I hope you enjoy.
